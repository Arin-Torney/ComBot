An Interactive Voice Assistant  
This was a voice assistant developed by me, as a fun code with the main idea from AY-KE-4519(now Rebuk-x). He told me that there are 2 modules called `pyttsx3` and `speech-recognition`. Then I searched for information about the modules and developed my own logic to build this simple yet powerful voice assistant. Later I added features like `wikipedia` module (it is buggy), `google` module etc. after taking more references and slightly improved it. For now this is no longer being maintained because of the glitches in computerised audio.  
### Note: Some of the issues are labeled "note from developer". These are issues created by developer more as an information than an issue (or maybe as an issue which can't be fixed but can be neglected).
